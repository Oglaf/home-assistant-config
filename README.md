## ‚ú® Dashboards

I utilize several custom dashboards, each tailored for a specific purpose, from high-level server monitoring to detailed device control.

### Main Dashboard
The main dashboard gives a comprehensive overview of the house. Key sections include family member locations, weather forecasts, and quick toggles for the most-used devices in the Office, Kitchen, Living Room, and Bedroom. It's designed for quick access to essential controls and information.

### Mobile Dashboard
Designed for on-the-go use, this dashboard is optimized for a mobile screen. It provides quick access to scenes, device controls, and status information for each room in a compact, scrollable format.

### Server & Network Dashboard
A technical dashboard dedicated to monitoring the health of my server and network infrastructure. It tracks WAN uptime, network speeds, and ping times to critical services like Cloudflare and Google. It also displays real-time CPU, RAM, and storage metrics for the main server and Hyper-V host.

### Energy Dashboard
This dashboard is the heart of my energy-saving efforts. It provides a detailed breakdown of energy consumption and costs for individual appliances like the computer, washing machine, and various lights. A historical graph tracks usage over time, helping to identify opportunities for more savings.

### Vacuum Dashboard
A dedicated control center for my vacuum cleaner. It allows for starting routines, cleaning specific rooms, and monitoring the status of the battery and maintenance items like the filter, brushes, and sensors.

## üöÄ Key Features & Automations

My configuration is packed with automations that make my home smarter and more efficient. Here are some highlights:

* **Adaptive Lighting:** Automatically adjusts the color temperature and brightness of lights throughout the day. The sunset offset is dynamically changed based on whether the sky is clear, ensuring the perfect lighting mood.
* **Automated Energy Tariffs:** The electricity tariff automatically switches between Peak, Shoulder, and Off-Peak rates throughout the day to accurately track energy costs.
* **Smart Office Environment:** The office lights turn on automatically at sunset if a computer is in use. When the last computer turns off, the lights and thermostat gracefully shut down.
* **Theater Mode:** When "Theater Mode" is activated, playing a movie automatically turns off the living room lights, and pausing the movie brings them back on for convenience.
* **Presence-Based Automation:** When everyone leaves the house, all lights and TVs are automatically turned off to save power.
* **Humidity Alerts:** The system compares indoor and outdoor humidity and sends a notification to open or close the windows to maintain the best indoor air quality.
* **Scheduled WoL:** My PC is automatically turned on via Wake-on-LAN on business days, ready for the workday.
* **Washing Machine Notifications:** I receive a notification on my phone as soon as the washing machine has finished its cycle.
